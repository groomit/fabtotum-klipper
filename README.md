This is the attempt to make Klipper run on the [Fabtotum Personal Fabricator](https://opentotum.github.io/fabtotum.com-backup/index.html) platform.
Fabtotum was designed as a modular CoreXY platform with exchangeable Toolheads i.e. for 3d Printing, Milling, Laser engraving
This repository has following goals:

1. Create a config file for Fabtotum with it's original Totumduino Board -> open
2. Create a config file for a modified Fabtotum with UART controlled TMC2209 Steppers -> open
3. Integrate the modular approach of the Fabtotum Platform (react to tool changes, custom g-codes) -> open
